RPN is a reverse polis notation calculator made in three languages for extra convenience!

To run it you need Go_, Python_ and Ruby_ installed. Then the go file needs to be built:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   go build -o logger

Finally run the cli interface and follow the instructions:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./rpn.rb

You can also calculate expressions with an input file as so:

.. code-block::bash

   ./rpn.rb < input.txt
